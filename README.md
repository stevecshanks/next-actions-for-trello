## What is it?

It brings together:

- all of your smaller todo items that don't merit their own board
- every card you are a member of
- the first card in each project's "Todo" list

## How do I set it up?

*Note: While I use this app pretty much every day, it's still a work in progress, so the steps below are a bit on the complex side*

1. `git clone` this repository somewhere
1. Make sure you have PHP 7.1 (at least) and Composer installed
1. `cd` to the repository you cloned and run `composer install` 
1. You'll obviously need a Trello board with at least two lists: one containing links to your project boards, and one containing a list of smaller tasks that don't merit their own board
1. Next you'll need to get some information from Trello:
    1. Get your Application Key at https://trello.com/app-key
    1. Change {YourAPIKey} to the key above and browse to https://trello.com/1/authorize?expiration=never&name=Next%20Actions%20For%20Trello&scope=read&response_type=token&key={YourAPIKey}
    1. You'll need the IDs of the two lists on your board - the easiest way to get it is to add `.json` after the board identifier in the URL e.g. `https://trello.com/b/abcd1234.json`.  Just search for the name of each list and you'll see the ID nearby.
1. You'll need to put these details somewhere the app can read then - either a `.env` file (see `.env.dist` for an example) or by exporting them as environment variables (again, see `.env.dist` for details of what you'd need to export)

## How do I use it?

```
make run
```

The application should then be available on localhost, with the port defaulting to 8000 e.g. [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

## How do I run the tests?

If you want to run the tests, just type:

```
make test
```
